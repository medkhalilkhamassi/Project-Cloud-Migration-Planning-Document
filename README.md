# Cloud Migration Planning Document: TechCorp Solutions

This repository contains the migration planning document and associated resources for migrating TechCorp Solutions' infrastructure from an on-premises setup to Microsoft Azure. The project simulates a real-world scenario to showcase cloud migration strategies, architecture design, and cost analysis.

## 📘 Project Overview

TechCorp Solutions is a mid-sized IT services company aiming to:
- Enhance scalability and reduce operational costs.
- Improve security and disaster recovery capabilities.
- Transition critical workloads to a cloud environment with minimal downtime.

This project involves creating a comprehensive migration plan that addresses these objectives while adhering to best practices.

## 🚀 Key Deliverables

1. **Migration Plan**:
   - A detailed step-by-step strategy for the migration process.
   - Includes workload prioritization and risk mitigation.

2. **Architecture Diagrams**:
   - Visual representations of the current and future infrastructure.

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Identifies potential migration risks and strategies to address them.

4. **Cost Estimation**:
   - Preliminary Azure cost analysis using the Azure Cost Calculator.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Azure Migrate**: Assessment and migration planning.
- **Azure Cost Management**: Cost analysis and optimization.
- **Lucidchart/Visio**: Architecture diagramming.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Resource inventory and cost comparisons.
